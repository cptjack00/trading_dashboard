# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repo scaffold: FastAPI (uvicorn) backend serving a Vite/React frontend as
  one process, with a `hmac`/`secrets`-based shared-secret login issuing a
  signed httpOnly session cookie. Binds only to a configured Tailscale
  address (never `0.0.0.0`); no TLS termination in-app. Systemd unit at
  `deploy/signal-deck.service`. (#1)
